# Expo config plugin for Carplay

Enabling this plugin will split the application into two [Scenes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/scenes):
one for presenting the Phone app and the other for implementing the CarPlay app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This config plugin makes your Expo project compatible with [react-native-carplay](https://github.com/birkir/react-native-carplay) v2.3.0,
> but only on the old architecture. The natural next step to make CarPlay work with the new architecture in React Native apps would be to rewrite this module using Turbo or Expo modules.
